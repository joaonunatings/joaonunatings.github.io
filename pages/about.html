		<p id="about-paragraph">Since I was little, I've had an inner force which pulls me to things related to technology.
			I always enjoyed sci-fi movies/books and the continuous research that made parts of fiction reality.
			There's also a special place in my heart for music (including the process of making it) and psychology.<br>
			Currently reading: <i>About Behaviorism</i> by <i>B.F. Skinner</i>.<br><br>
			As of today, I'm a junior engineer with a degree in Computer Science.<br><br>
			As for the future, I might study abroad for my master's degree. Time will tell.
